                        of 26 million
                        children are at risk.In the world’s hungriest countries, children too young to walk are
                        surviving on
                        one meal a day, sometimes less. Entire classrooms are empty because students are too hungry to
                        go to
                        school, while some families don’t know what or when they’ll eat next.</p>

                        Being forcibly displaced from your home is not easy. It is coloured with no choice, where the
                        affected are in flight to shelter themselves from calamity, war, persecution, and destruction.
                        There
                        exists an increasing trend of the number of people displaced each year. In 2017, this number was
                        70.8M globally. In 2019, the UNHCR reported the number to be 86.5M. Every second one of these is
                        a
                        child - a lot of them have lost their parents, and are forced to survive alone.</p>
